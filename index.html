      Quote 1 </a> </h3>
  <em>By Mother Teresa </em>
  <ul>
    <li>People are often unreasonable and self-centered. <strong>Forgive them anyway. </strong></li>
    <li>If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives. <strong>Be kind anyway. </strong> </li>
    <li>If you are honest, people may cheat you. <strong>Be honest anyway. </strong> </li>
    <li>If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies. Succeed anyway. </li>
    <li>If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you. Be honest and frank anyway. </li>
    <li>What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight. Build anyway. </li>
    <li>If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous. Be happy anyway. </li>
    <li>The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow. Do good anyway. </li>
    <li>Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. </li>
    <li>You see, in the end, it is between you and your God. It was never between you and them anyway. </li>
  </ul>
